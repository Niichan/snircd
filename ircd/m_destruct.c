 * ms_destruct - server message handler
 *
 * Added 1997 by Run, actually coded and used since 2002.
 *
 * parv[0] = sender prefix
 * parv[1] = channel channelname
 * parv[2] = channel time stamp
 *
 * This message is intended to destruct _empty_ channels.
 *
 * The reason it is needed is to somehow add the notion
 * "I destructed information" to the networks state
 * (also messages that are still propagating are part
 *  of the global state).  Without it the network could
 * easily be desynced as a result of destructing a channel
 * on only a part of the network while keeping the modes
 * and creation time on others.
 * There are three possible ways a DESTRUCT message is
 * handled by remote servers:
 * 1) The channel is empty and has the same timestamp
 *    as on the message.  Conclusion: The channel has
 *    not been destructed and recreated in the meantime,
 *    this means that the normal synchronization rules
 *    account and we react as if we decided to destruct
 *    the channel ourselves: we destruct the channel and
 *    send a DESTRUCT in all directions.
 * 2) The channel is not empty.  In case we cannot remove
 *    it and do not propagate the DESTRUCT message. Instead
 *    a resynchronizing BURST message is sent upstream
 *    in order to restore the channel on that side (which
 *    will have a TS younger than the current channel if
 *    it was recreated and will thus be fully synced, just
 *    like in the case of a real net-junction).
 * 3) The channel is empty, but the creation time of the
 *    channel is older than the timestamp on the message.
 *    This can happen when there is more than one minute
 *    lag and remotely a channel was created slightly
 *    after we created the channel, being abandoned again
 *    and staying empty for a minute without that our
 *    CREATE reached that remote server.  The remote server
 *    then could have generated the DESTRUCT.  In the meantime
 *    our user also left the channel.  We can ignore the
 *    destruct because it comes from an 'area' that will
 *    be overridden by our own CREATE: the state that generated
 *    this DESTRUCT is 'history'.
